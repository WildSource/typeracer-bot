# typeracer-bot
A typeracer bot written in java. Made this for learning purposes and because it's a fun project.
# usage
Download the release.
The release contains the executable and a very important folder called tessdata.
The folder must be at the same directory as the executabe.
A little tip is to create a shortcut of the executable that you can place anywhere instead of moving the executable and its dependency.
Other than that just double click on it.
A window will popup.
