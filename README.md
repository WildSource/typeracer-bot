A typeracer bot written in java. Made this for learning purposes and because it's a fun project.
# usage
Download the release. <br>
The release contains the executable and a very important folder called tessdata.<br>
The folder must be at the same directory as the executabe.<br>
A little tip is to create a shortcut of the executable that you can place anywhere instead of moving the executable and its dependency.<br>
Other than that just double click on it.<br>
A window will popup. <br>
